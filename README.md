# DistributedCast
A Podcast aggregator made for the Distributed Applications Development Course I took in 2019 @ Universidade Federal do Cear√°

This Application is hosted on AWS @ [DistCast](http://distcastportal.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

I wrote the backend using Python and Flask, the frontend application using Angular 8.
